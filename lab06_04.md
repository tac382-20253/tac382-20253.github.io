# Bendy Shader
Now let's hit the bendy part.\
To bend objects, we need to move their vertices.\
That means we must operate in the Vertex Shader.\
First, let's take a closer look at the text version.
```
        void vert(inout appdata_full v)
        {
            float4 pos = mul(UNITY_MATRIX_MV, v.vertex);
            float zSq = 0.01 * pos.z * pos.z;
            pos.x += _BendyX * zSq;
            pos.y += _BendyY * zSq;
            v.vertex = mul(pos, UNITY_MATRIX_IT_MV);
        }
```
The first line
```
float4 pos = mul(UNITY_MATRIX_MV, v.vertex);
```
That's a matrix multiply. A matrix called `UNITY_MATRIX_MV` is multiplied times the input vertex position `v.vertex`.\
The `UNITY_MATRIX_MV` matrix transforms from *Model Space* (also called *Object Space*) into *View Space*.\
In *View Space*, the forward direction is Z. This means `pos.z` is the distance from the camera.\
The second line
```
float zSq = 0.01 * pos.z * pos.z;
```
squares the distance and multiplies that by a constant `0.01`.
The next 2 lines
```
pos.x += _BendyX * zSq;
pos.y += _BendyY * zSq;
```
Bends the position in the X and Y direction based on how far from the camera the vertex is.\
The last line
```
v.vertex = mul(pos, UNITY_MATRIX_IT_MV);
```
puts the position back into *Model Space* (aka *Object Space*).

{: .note}
This is not actually a *Vertex Shader*.\
Unity gives us this *surface shader* which is really a piece inserted in the front of their standard *Vertex Shader*.

# Shader Graph
Let's translate that in the Shader Graph.

## Z-Squared

{: .todo}
* Shader Graph makes the *View Space* position available
    * Add a "Position" node and select "View" space
* Use a "Split" node to extract the Z coordinate (Labeled "B")
* Use a "Multiply" node to square the *View Space* z
* And one more "Multiply" node to multiply by 0.01

## BendyX and BendyY
The next thing in the text version is to multiply by BendyX and BendyY.

{: .todo}
* Create 2 float parameters called "_BendyX" and "_BendyY"
* Set their default values to 1
    * I'm not certain this works as expected... if nothing happens, try exposing the parameters (see below) and setting them to 1 in the editor as a test. Then set them back to not-exposed after verifying they work.
* Mark these 2 parameters as **not** Exposed
![Not Exposed](images/lab06/bendyx.jpg "Not Exposed")

{: .note}
"_BendyX" and "_BendyY" are *global* parameters.\
That means these are not set separately for each material, but are shared by all materials that use this shader.\
"Exposed" parameters are set on a per-material basis.\
Not-"Exposed" parameters are set globally.

{: .todo}
* Drag "_BendyX" and "_Bendy" into your graph
* Use "Multiply" and "Add" nodes to perform this math
```
pos.x += _BendyX * zSq;
pos.y += _BendyY * zSq;
```
* Remember that `pos` is the *view-space* position

## Transform back to Model/Object Space

{: .todo}
* Use a "Transform" node to transform the resulting `pos` from *View Space* into *Object Space* (aka *Model Space*)
* Feed that into "Position" input on the "Vertex"

{: .test}
In the scene view, you should see that everything seems to work, but the curve is too slight to really see.
![Slight Bend](images/lab06/bendy1.jpg "Slight Bend")
Change that 0.01 constant in your shader to 0.1, and you'll see a dramatic effect.
![Big Bend](images/lab06/bendy2.jpg "Big Bend")

{: .warn}
Put the 0.01 constant back.\
Then commit and push before we go on
