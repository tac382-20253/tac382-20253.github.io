# Resources/Games.xml
In your Assets folder, you'll find a Resources sub-folder.\
Unity allows us to load assets directly from the Resources folder.\
Open up the Games.xml file in your text editor to take a look.
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<QuizList xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

</QuizList>
```
This is a simple XML file describing the data for our first quiz.\
As you can see, this file describes something of type **QuizList** which itself contains a series of elements of type **QuizElement**.

# QuizGame.cs
The classes **QuizElement** and **QuizList** can be found inside the class **QuizGame**.\
**QuizElement** is just a string, but as the comment says, this allows us to add more data later.
```
    public class QuizElement
    {
        // we only have a single string in here, but made it a class in case you ever want to expand
        public string text;
    }
```
\
**QuizList** is the list of **QuizElement**s
```
    public class QuizList
    {
        // this is nothing but a list, but like QuizElement, the class allows us to expand easily
        public List<QuizElement> elements;
    }
```
The bulk of the game is handled within the **QuizGame** class.

## public variables
At the top of the class, you'll find the public variables. These are the pieces that are exposed in the editor,
so this is how everything is hooked up.\
`m_text` is where we will be putting the strings from the **QuizList**.\
We need `m_background` to change the color for the "Correct" and "Wrong" messages.\
Next up, we have *prefabs* for those "Correct" and "Wrong" screens. We will get the colors from those.

{: .note}
For more information about *prefabs*, check out this supplementary video: [Prefabs](https://youtu.be/bOIAkIdOc6o)

After that, you'll see sounds that we'll play when the player makes a choice.

{: .note}
We'll talk about audio in more detail in week 4. For now, I've set it up to play the sounds. You won't have to do anything with those.

Finally, we have 2 angles that determine how far the player needs to tilt the phone.\
These are in degrees. I've chosen angles that I think work well, but you'll need to write the code to detect the tilt angle in part 4.

## QuizInput
**QuizInput** is another class-within-a-class.
```
    /// <summary>
    /// Bundle up all the potential input values
    /// These are "abstracted" away from the input mechanism
    /// This "decouples" the input commands from the input mechanism
    /// This makes it easy to create alternative input mechanisms (keyboard, joystick, AI, etc)
    /// </summary>
    class QuizInput
    {
        public bool up = false;
        public bool down = false;
        public bool center = true;
    }
```
The input for this game is very simple. It's just tilt up or tilt down.\
But I've set it up as 3 separate bools.\
As the comment says, the purpose of this class is to create an abstraction to separate
the idea of the tilt angle apart from the concept of choosing "Correct" vs "Wrong".\
This allows us to set up alternative input methods and get the same output.

# GameManager.cs
We'll spend plenty of time in the **QuizGame** class as we go, but for now let's take a look at **GameManager**.\
This class manages the flow of the game.\
If you pause the game, that's handled here.\
We will also be using the **GameManager** class to choose which XML file to use.
