# Playfield.cs
There are some **TODO**s in "Playfield.cs".\
Scroll down to the bottom to find these. We'll be handling the first 2 of these now.
```
public class Playfield : MonoBehaviour
{
	...
	// TODO Add public function void DeleteSelectedObject()
    // If there is a currently selected object, call DeleteObject() to delete it

    // TODO Add public function void RotateSelectedObject(float amount)
    // If there is a currently selected object, rotate that object by the amount specified
    // Negative rotation values rotate the object counter-clockwise

    // TODO add public function void SaveCity()
    // Save the city configuration to "City.xml"

    // TODO add public function void LoadCity()
    // Load the city configuration to "City.xml"
    // And instantiate all the objects in that file
}
```

# Delete Objects

{: .todo}
* Create public function `void DeleteSelectedObject()`
* If there is a currently selected object call DeleteObject() to delete it
    * You can use `GetSelectedObject()`
* Hook up the "Canvas/DeleteObj" button to call this function on click

{: .test}
You should be able to delete objects from the scene now.\
Double-check that this button does nothing when you have no objects selected.

# Rotate Objects

{: .todo}
* Create public function `void RotateSelectedObject(float amount)`
    * This takes a float parameter `amount`
* If there is a selected object, rotate that object around the Y axis by the specified amount.
    * You can use `GetSelectedObject()`
* Hook up the "Canvas/RotateCCW" and "Canvas/RotateCW" buttons to call this function on click
    * "RotateCW" should turn the object by 90 degrees
    * "RotateCCW" should turn the object by -90 degrees

{: .test}
You can now rotate the objects.\
Watch out... many of them look pretty much the same from any orientation.

{: .warn}
That wasn't too bad, but let's commit and push.
