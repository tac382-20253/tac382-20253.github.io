We have finished with the basic requirements for the lab.\
Everyone should now have a working game.\
At this point, we will each choose our path for the completion of the lab.\
We have 3 paths to choose from. You may choose whatever you want, but for full credit, you must complete just 1 of the 3 tasks listed below:
* Programming
* Design
* Art

# Programming
Programmers will be creating more interesting paths for the missiles.\
A Cubic Bezier curve follows the following formula:\
`x = A * (1-t)^3 + 3 * B * (1-t)^2 * t + 3 * C * (1-t) * t^2 + D * t^3`\
As t goes from 0 to 1, x goes from A to D.\
B and C control the direction of a curving path to get from A to D.\
If you set up A, B, C, and D to be `Vector3`s, you'll get a 3D path through space.

{: .todo}
* Create class **BezierCubic**
    * Give it the 4 control points A, B, C, and D
* The motion of the missiles is currently in Missile.cs
* Use your **BezierCubic** to change the motion of **Missile** from a straight line into a Bezier Curve
    * Use the starting point and ending point of the missile to set control points A and D
    * Get a little creative with control points B and C
    * Try to make sure the missiles stay on screen

{: .note}
The vector (B-A) sets the initial velocity vector for the path as it leaves control point A.\
The vector (D-C) sets the final velocity vector as the path arrives at D.\
Use this understanding with some randomization to make intersting curves that make sense for your missiles.

# Design
Let's make the level sequence a little more interesting.\
The bomb dropping sequence is handled in the *coroutine* `FireControl.DropBomb()`

{: .todo}
* Change the bomb pattern from a random one to a pre-determined sequence
	* Use an XML file format to describe the pre-determined sequence
* Have the difficulty ramp up over a period of 30 seconds
* After the completed sequence (30 seconds), you can just loop back to the start

# Art
We've got to do something about that programmer art.

{: .todo}
* Replace the Sprite for the "Alive" city
* Replace the "Dead" city with a sequence of at least 3 images showing the destruction of the city
* Set the "Dead" animation to be non-looping so that it remains in the final frame of animation
