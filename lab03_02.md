# FireControl.cs
The game is controlled by the **FireControl** class.

## Public Variables
First let's look at the public variables.
```
    public GameObject m_crossHair;
    public GameObject m_missile;
    public GameObject m_bomb;
    public GameObject m_city;
    public int m_numCity = 3;
    public float m_bombMinTime = 0.25f;
    public float m_bombMaxTime = 1.0f;
    public GameObject m_pauseMenu;
```
The `GameObject`s are *prefabs* that you'll need to create and assign.\
These things will be spawned by the script when the game begins.

## Private Variables
```
    List<GameObject> m_targets;     // a list of all the targeting reticles (one for each finger that's touching the screen)
    List<City> m_cities;

    bool m_isPaused = false;
```
`m_cities` is a list of the cities that get spawned in when the game begins.\
`m_targets` isn't used yet. You're going to set that up as a list of aiming reticles that indicate where the player is touching the screen.

## FireMissile()
Most of the game's functionality is already set up for you.\
The `FireMissile()` function takes care of creating a **Missile** based on the *prefab* and sending it towards the specified location.

## DropBomb()
The enemy's weapons are called "bombs" to differentiate them from the player's "missiles".\
`DropBomb()` spawns a **Bomb** based on the *prefab* and randomly aims it at one of the player's cities.\
It then repeats that process after a random delay until the player has run out of cities to attack.

# Missile.cs
**Missile**s take a straight path towards their target, and then they explode.\
In this case, exploding means they spawn a *prefab* with a **MissileExplosion** on it.\
You'll be creating the *prefab* for that.

# Bomb.cs
**Bomb**s take a straight path towards one of the player's cities, and explode when they get there.\
They explode by creating a new instance of a *prefab* `m_explosion` which you will also be creating.

{: .note}
The **Bomb** class also has a **LineRenderer** set up for you.\
We won't really be covering that topic in class, but maybe you'll want to take a look at how it works for your own reference.
