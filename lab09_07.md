We have finished with the basic requirements for the lab.\
Everyone should now have a working game.\
At this point, we will each choose our path for the completion of the lab.\
We have 3 paths to choose from. You may choose whatever you want, but for full credit, you must complete just 1 of the 3 tasks listed below:
* Programming
* Design
* Art

# Programming
In Clash of Clans, there are different types of troops to choose from.\
Let's set something up for that.

{: .todo}
* Create a 2nd character based on the content in "Assets/RPG Tiny Hero Duo/Prefab/FemaleCharacter.prefab"
* Give it different parameters
	* movement speed
	* attack delay
	* attack damage
* Create a 2nd UI image and separate counter for it
* Make the UI images into buttons
	* Allow the player to select which unit to deploy

# Design
In Clash of Clans, some of the buildings fight back.

{: .todo}
* Give the **Character** class some hit points
* Give some of the buildings some sort of defensive ability
	* A projectile attack
	* An AE attack
	* Whatever
* Try to tune it so that the buildings can be defeated
	* The ideal tuning would be such that smart placement of the troops is the key to victory

# Art
Back in Lab07, the art choice was to create destroyed versions of the buildigs.\
Let's put those to use.

{: .todo}
* When a building is destroyed, swap it out for the destroyed version.
* You'll find the code for a destroyed building in `Destructable.Damage()`

{: .warn}
Be sure to commit and push everything.
