We have finished with the basic requirements for the lab.\
Everyone should now have a working game.\
At this point, we will each choose our path for the completion of the lab.\
We have 3 paths to choose from. You may choose whatever you want, but for full credit, you must complete just 1 of the 3 tasks listed below:
* Programming
* Design
* Art

# Programming
Doing the curved world with a shader gives us the unique opportunity of changing the bend in real time.

{: .todo}
* Set it up so that the bend direction and amount varies as you play
	* The bend variation must be smooth enough that it is not jarring
	* Make sure it bends often enough that we will definitely see it within 30 seconds

# Design
We've got the basic building blocks of a game here, but the 3 sections don't provide much variety.

{: .todo}
* Create at least 3 more sections
	* Try to show some more interesting flow
* Make the player speed up as the game progresses
	* Make sure the speed-up is clearly obvious within 30 seconds or less
	* There are multiple ways you might approach this

# Art
It's considered bad form to leave any blank sky on the screen.

{: .todo}
* Create a skybox to fill any gaps on the horizon

{: .warn}
Be sure to commit and push everything.
