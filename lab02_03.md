# QuizGame.Start()
In the class **QuizGame**, look for the **TODO** in the `Start()` function.
```
    void Start()
    {
        ...
        {   // TODO load in the TextAsset for the specified "file"
        }
        ...
    }
```

{: .todo}
* You can get the filename for the **TextAsset** with the static function `GameManager.GetXMLFile()`

{: .note}
A `static` function does not refer to any *instance* of a class.\
This lets us communicate a piece of data between scenes.\
When a scene transitions, the objects are destroyed, but we want this data to pass from one scene to another.\
We have used a static function to get the name of the file from one scene to another.

{: .todo}
* Load the **TextAsset** with `Resources.Load<TextAsset>()`
* Use the **TextAsset** to construct a new **StringReader**
* Create an **XmlSerializer** of type **QuizList** like so: `new XmlSerializer(typeof(QuizList))`
* Use the function `Deserialize()` on your **XmlSerializer** using your **StringReader** as input
* Set `m_list` to the results of the `Deserialize()`
    * You will have to convert the output of `Deserialize()` to be of type **QuizList**.
* Release the **TextAsset** by calling `Resources.UnloadAsset()` with it
    * Once the text has been read in and parsed, we do not need to keep the XML file loaded.
    * We have to call `Resources.UnloadAsset()` to release the memory.

# QuizGame.NextQuestion()
Look for the **TODO** in the function `NextQuestion()`.
```
    bool NextQuestion()
    {
        bool ret = true;

        {
            // TODO advance to the next element in the list
            // set m_text.text to the text of the new question
            // If the list is NOT over, set ret = false
        }

        // reset the colors to the original colors for the question
        m_text.color = m_origTextColor;
        m_background.color = m_origBackgroundColor;
        return ret;
    }
```

{: .todo}
* The list of questions can be found inside `m_list`
* The index of the current question is `m_listElement` (it starts off as -1)
* If we are not yet at the last question, advance to the next index
* Set the on-screen text element `m_text.text` to the next question
* Set the value of `ret` to `true` or `false` as appropriate
    * If you could NOT update `m_listElement` because we're already at the end, set `ret = true`
    * If you DID update `m_listElement` to the next question, set `ret = false`

{: .note}
You will have noticed that I'm putting these **TODO** blocks in *block scopes*.
A *block scope* is just a block of code in brackets.\
You can use these to organize code any way you want.\
I find them useful because the contain the *scope* of variables.\
A variable declared inside the *scope* cannot be accessed outside the *scope*.\
This helps prevent accidental use of the wrong variables.
```
        {   // TODO load in the TextAsset for the specified "file"
            // this is a "block scope"
        }
```

{: .test}
Give it a try.\
The game will start, but you can't get past the first question yet.\
The first correct answer is "Tony Hawk".
