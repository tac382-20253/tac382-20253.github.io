# Clone the Repo
![Clone The Repo](images/gitclone.jpg "Clone The Repo")

This is the starting point for the project.\
We will start off with an existing project.

{: .test}
Open your starting project in Unity.\
There is 1 scene in the project.\
Open the Game scene.\
It should look like this...
![Starting Project](images/lab03/start_point.jpg "Starting Project")

{: .test}
If you hit Play In Editor, an error will come up, and the game will say it's paused.

{: .note}
You may also notice the error message that appears in the console window.\
If you click on the error message, you'll get more information complete with a callstack.\
The error occurs in Assets/Scripts/FireControl.cs on line 30.\
We'll fix this later. For now, I just want you to know how to use error messages to debug your code.
