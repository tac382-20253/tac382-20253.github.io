# Deck.GetCard()

In the class **Deck**, fill out the function `GetCard()`.
```
    public Card GetCard()
    {
        Card card = null;
        // TODO take the next card if there is one
        
        if (m_cards.Count <= 0)
        {   // if we're out of cards, gray out the deck image
            Image image = GetComponent<Image>();
            image.color = new Color(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f, 0.5f);
        }
        return card;
    }
```

{: .todo}
* If there are no **Card**s left in the `m_card` List, `card` should return `null`.
* Otherwise, remove one `card` from the List `m_card`.
* Use `SetActive` to activate that `card`'s **GameObject**.
* Return that.

{: .test}
Try it out. Hit Play In Editor.\

{: .note}
The order of the cards may vary depending on how you implemented the function.\
We'll do shuffling later.

# Game.PlayerHit()

In the class **Game**, fill in the function `PlayerHit()`.
```
    public void PlayerHit()
    {
        // TODO call GetCard() to get the next card from the deck and add it to the player's hand
        // call UpdatePlayerScore() to recalculate the player's score
        // if the player busts (score > 21), call PlayerStay()
    }
```

{: .todo}
* Call `GetCard` on the **Deck** to get a **Card**.
* Add that **Card** to the player's **Hand**.
* Call `UpdatePlayerScore` to calculate the player's new score.
* If the player busts (score exceeds 21), call `PlayerStay` to end the player's turn.

{: .test}
Try it out. Hit Play In Editor.\
The hit button should add cards to the player's hand.\

{: .note}
We still haven't shuffled the deck.\
The score doesn't work yet.

# Debug Get Card
It can be difficult to test all the different combinations of cards unless you have some way to control which card you get from the deck.
{: .todo }
* Add a function `public Card GetCardWithRank(int rank)` to the **Deck** class.
	* Loop through the deck to find the next available card with the specified rank.
	* Remove that card from the deck.
	* Return the card.
	* If no matching card can be found, return null.
* Add an `Update` function to the **Game** class.
	* Use `Input.GetKeyDown()` to check for a key press
		* If the key is `KeyCode.Alpha0` (the 0 key on the top row of the keyboard):
			* Call `GetCardWithRank(0)` to get a joker card
		* If the key is `KeyCode.Alpha1` (the 1 key on the keyboard)
			* Get an ace card by calling `GetCardWithRank(1)`
		* Continue this pattern for ranks 2-9
		* Use `KeyCode.J` for Jack, `KeyCode.Q` for Queen, and `KeyCode.K` for King
		* Add the card to the player's hand

{: .note}
You could do this with a series of if statements, but that's pretty tedious.\
Can you think of a way to do this with a for loop?\
You would need a list (array) of key codes along with list of rank numbers.

{: .test}
Make sure this works.\
Those first 2 cards will make it impossible to test every combination.
To avoid that, simply comment out the 2 cards that are dealt to the player in `Game.Deal()`.
