We have finished with the basic requirements for the lab.\
Everyone should now have a working game.\
At this point, we will each choose our path for the completion of the lab.\
We have 3 paths to choose from. You may choose whatever you want, but for full credit, you must complete just 1 of the 3 tasks listed below:
* Programming
* Design
* Art

# Programming
The programming task is to set up a score scene.

{: .todo}
* Keep track of the number of "Correct" and "Wrong" answers
* In the "End" scene, display the final score
* While you're at it, please shuffle the list of questions each time the game is played

# Design
For design, let's turn the game into and "Over & Under" thing.

{: .todo}
* Instead of "Correct" vs "Wrong", change each question to "Higher" or "Lower"
* Instead of trying to guess the word, have the player guess if the correct answer is "Higher" or "Lower" than the phrase shown
    * For example, "tallest tree 190 feet"
* To guess "Higher", the player must tilt the phone up
* To guess "Lower", the player tilts the phone down
* Your **QuizElement**s are going to be longer, so you'll probably need to adjust the font size.
* The **QuizElement** also needs an additional field to tell whether the correct response is "Higher" or "Lower"

# Art
The art project is to create a character that will be the face of our game.

{: .todo}
* The character need only be presented as 2D images - sprites
* We want 5 different images of the same character:
    * Introducing the game in the "Start" scene
    * Presenting the answer in the "Game" scene
    * Announcing "Correct" in the "Game" scene
    * Declaring "Wrong" in the "Game" scene
    * Offering to play again in the "End" scene
* They can be any quality. Simple sketches will do
