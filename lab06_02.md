# Player
The Player object in the scene is the cat.\
It has a fully animated geometry I got from here: [Trash Dash](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/endless-runner-sample-game-87901)\
The player moves by means of Unity's built-in **CharacterController**.

## Player.cs
Let's take a look at the **Player** script.
```
public class Player : MonoBehaviour

```
In `Update()` you'll see that the movement is passed into `m_charController`.\
The track is divided into 3 "zones": left, right, and center.\
The side-to-side motion is controlled by `m_zone`... the character is pushed towards the location of `m_zone`.\
Functions `SwipeLeft()` and `SwipeRight()` change the player's target `m_zone` through calls to `ChangeTrack()`.\
But what calls `SwipeLeft()` and `SwipeRight()`?\
Up in the `Start()` function, you'll see there is a **Swiper**, and these functions are registered with that.

# Swiper.cs
I won't paste the whole thing... you can go look at it.\
You should see that it implements the UI drag handlers and the real work happens in `CheckDrag()`\
This must mean there is a **Swiper** component somewhere in the Scene's UI.\
You will find it as "Canvas/SwipeZone" in the Scene hierarchy, and you'll see that it fills the entire screen.

# FollowCam.cs
As the player runs, we need the camera to keep up.\
In the Scene, "MainCamera" has a **FollowCam** on it.\
If you look at the script, you'll see it uses `InverseTransformPoint()` and `TransformPoint()` to keep the camera's position relative to the player.\
Also of note is the use of `LateUpdate()` to ensure that the player is updated *before* the camera.

# TrackController.cs
Finally, we need to keep making more track as you run.\
`TrackController.Update()` generates new track in sections as you go, and deletes them as they fall behind.\
We have an array of `m_trackPrefabs` to randomly select from to keep the game varied.

# Object Pools

## ObjectPool.cs
This file has a lot of **TODO**s in it. This is where a lot of our work will take place.\
An **ObjectPool** is effectively a **List<>** of **GameObject**s available for use.\
When you need to *spawn* a particular type of object (in our case a banana), you pull one from the matching **ObjectPool**.\
When you're done with that object, we don't delete it. Instead, we return it to the **ObjectPool**.\
Each **ObjectPool** has only 1 type of object in it. (We'll have 2: bananas, and pickup effects.)

## PooledObject.cs
When you want to make an **ObjectPool** out of something, use **PooledObject** as a base class to keep track of which **ObjectPool** it came from.

## SpawnPools.cs
We have 2 **ObjectPool**s in our game: bananas and pickup effects.\
To access the pools from anywhere, I have set up a class **SpawnPools** with public variables to access the pools.\
**SpawnPools** has a public getter `SpawnPools.Get()` to make it accessible from anywhere.\
In a real version of this game, we might want pools for lots of other stuff as well, but this should be enough to get the idea across.
