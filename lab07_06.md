# City
Check out the class I have already set up for in in "Playfield.cs" called **City**
```
public class Playfield : MonoBehaviour
{
...
    /// <summary>
    /// This is the data structure we will be saving and loading
    /// City holds the entire city as a list of Element
    /// </summary>
    public class City
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// An Element is one object (like a building) in the City
        /// </summary>
        public class Element
        {
            public string m_type;
            public int m_x;
            public int m_z;
            public float m_rot;
        }
        public List<Element> m_elements;
    }
...
    // TODO add public function void SaveCity()
    // Save the city configuration to "City.xml"

    // TODO add public function void LoadCity()
    // Load the city configuration to "City.xml"
    // And instantiate all the objects in that file
}
```
By declaring a public class like this, C# will be able to serialize that in and out as an XML file using the standard XML serialization library.

{: .note)
**City** is a class declared within the class **Playfield**.\
And **Element** is a class within **City**.\
Therefore, it is **Playfield.City.Element**.

# Save

{: .todo}
* **TODO** add public function void SaveCity()
* Create a new local instance of a **City**
* Go through all the objects in `m_objects`
    * Make a matching **City.Element** for each element of `m_objects`
    * The `Key` for `m_objects` is the **GameObject**
        * `m_type` is for the name of the object
            * The name of the object is going to have (clone) on the end of it
            * strip the (clone) off the name that you store in `m_type`
        * `m_rot` is for storing the Y-rotation of the object
    * The `Value` for `m_objects` is a **Vector2Int** of where that object is in the grid
        * `m_x` and `m_z` should store that information
    * Add all these **City.Element**s to `m_elements`
* Create a **StreamWriter** to save the file
    * Put the file at `Application.persistentDataPath + "/City.xml"`
* Create an **XmlSerializer** of type **City**
* `Serialize()` your **City** to your **StreamWriter** using the **XmlSerializer**

{: .note}
User-saved data should be put into the folder `Application.persistentDataPath`.\
Different platforms have different rules for where these files go.\
Using that accessor ensures that the files are stored in the correct place on any platform.

{: .warn}
Saving files to the wrong folder is likely to work in editor and fail on mobile platforms.\
Never attempt to save files into local folders unless you are making an editor tool.

# Load

{: .todo}
* **TODO** add public function void LoadCity()
* First clear out any objects in the **Playfield** with a call to `ClearObjects()`
* Create a new **StreamReader** 
    * Open the file at `Application.persistentDataPath + "/City.xml"`
* Read the file into a **string**
* Create a **StringReader** from that **string**
* Create an **XmlSerializer** of type **City**
* `Deserialize()` the **StringReader** using your **XmlSerializer**
    * This should create a new local variable of type **City**
* Instantiate all the objects in the **City**
    * `m_prototypes` is the parent of all the **Prototype** objects
    * Search through the children of `m_prototypes` to find one with a `name` matching `m_type`
    * If a match is found, call `Prototype.MakeOne()` to instantiate one
    * Use `MoveObject()` to place the new object into the **Playfield** in the correct location
        * Make a **Vector2Int** out of `m_x` and `m_z`
    * Set the Y-axis rotation accoring to `m_rot`

{: .test}
You should be able to save your scenes and load them.\
Make sure loading a scene erases the old one.

{: .warn}
Let's commit and push.
