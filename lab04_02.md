# Game Scene

## Main Camera
The "Main Camera" object has a **FollowCamera** on it.
```
public class FollowCamera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform m_target;

    Vector3 m_offset;
    Vector3 m_original;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        if (null == m_target)
        {
            m_target = FindObjectOfType<PlayerBird>().transform;
        }
        m_original = transform.position;
        m_offset = m_original - m_target.position;
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void LateUpdate()
    {
        if (null != m_target)
        {
            Vector3 pos = m_target.position + m_offset;
            pos.y = m_original.y;
            pos.z = m_original.z;
            transform.position = pos;
        }
    }
}
```
This script just makes the camera follow along with its `m_target` (the player),
but only along the x axis.

{: .note}
I've used the `LateUpdate()` function to make sure the player moves first and then the camera follows after.

## Penguin
The "Penguin" object is a prefab with an animated sprite on it.\
It has a **PlayerBird** script attached to it already.

## Sky
"Sky" has a **RepeatBackground** on it. We'll be doing some work in that script soon.\
"Sky" has a single child object "Image" with a sprite on it.

## GameManager
We'll be managing the flow of the game through the **GameManager** script, and one is already attached here.\
You may notice that there's a pause menu already set up, and that is managed through the **GameManager**.

# PlayerBird.cs
```
public class PlayerBird : Bird
{
    public float m_forwardSpeed = 3.0f;

    // Update is called once per frame
    protected override void Update()
    {
        m_flap = Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) || Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space);
        m_glide = m_flap || Input.GetMouseButton(0) || Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space);

        {   // TODO Move the player bird forward at a rate of m_forwardSpeed (units per second)
        }

        base.Update();
    }
}
```
**PlayerBird** doesn't do much other than inherit from **Bird**.\
When I set that up, I imagined that you might want to re-use the bird behavior to create enemy birds to avoid or something like that.
