We have finished with the basic requirements for the lab.\
Everyone should now have a working game.\
At this point, we will each choose our path for the completion of the lab.\
We have 3 paths to choose from. You may choose whatever you want, but for full credit, you must complete just 1 of the 3 tasks listed below:
* Programming
* Design
* Art

# Programming

The programming task is to work in the jokers.

{: .todo}
* Add the jokers into the deck in `Deck.Start()`.
* Update `Hand.Score()` to accomodate the jokers.
* Each joker can duplicate any other card in the hand. (You are not allowed to copy another joker.)
* You must choose which card is most advantageous to copy.
* Note that aces could be worth 1 point or 11. When you copy them with a joker, you would be coping the *card* not just the card's *value*.
	* For example, Ace + Joker counts as 12 points not 22.
* The value of the joker may be considered zero if that is the most advantageous.
* A pair of jokers has zero value by themselves.

# Design

The design job should be creative...

{: .todo}
* Come up with a creative way to score the hand.
* Use the suit of the cards in some way.
* You can change the number 21, but there must be some way to bust.
* Don't just *design* the rules. You need to *implement* them in the game.
* Add a README.md file that briefly describes the scoring so we'll know how to play your game.

# Art

For the artists among us, let's create some art.

{: .todo}
* Create a new sprite for the "Hit" and "Stay" buttons. (And apply it to them.)
* Create a new sprite for the score backgrounds. (And apply it to them.)
* Create a new sprite for the "Play Again" button. (And apply it.)
* Create new sprites for the "You Win" and "Dealer Wins" banners. (And apply them. You probably want to change their colors too.)
* You can do whatever you want with this, but try to make them thematically coordinated.
