We have finished with the basic requirements for the lab.\
Everyone should now have a working game.\
At this point, we will each choose our path for the completion of the lab.\
We have 3 paths to choose from. You may choose whatever you want, but for full credit, you must complete just 1 of the 3 tasks listed below:
* Programming
* Design
* Art

# Programming
Let's keep score.

{: .todo}
* Put a timer in the UI that shows minutes, seconds, and 10ths of seconds.
	* Display it in the format min:sec.tenths eg 0:12.3 (0 minutes 12.3 seconds)
	* The timer should start at 0:00.0 and count up from there
* Put a score in the UI
	* Assign points for each pipe the player passes
* Be sure to reset the timer and the score each time the level resets

# Design
We need some level progression here.\
Make the game become more challenging the longer you play.

{: .todo}
* Perhaps the player's speed should increase over time.
* Maybe the spacing of the pipes could change over time.
* Leave a note in the README.md file telling the graders what to expect.

# Art
I ripped those pipes off the internet, and they look suspicously like something out of a Mario game.

{: .todo}
* Replace the pipes with something else
	* Preferably something other than a pipe
* Replace the tiled sky image with something else
	* Find a theme that works together with your replaced pipes
* Feel free to replace the player's sprite as well if you feel like it
	* This won't be required

{: .warn}
Be sure to commit and push everything.
