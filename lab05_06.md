We have finished with the basic requirements for the lab.\
Everyone should now have a working game.\
At this point, we will each choose our path for the completion of the lab.\
We have 3 paths to choose from. You may choose whatever you want, but for full credit, you must complete just 1 of the 3 tasks listed below:
* Programming
* Design
* Art

# Programming
Special Moves

{: .todo}
* If the user makes a match of 5 or more in a single row, break the entire map
* If there is an L-shaped match (3 or more horizontal and 3 or more vertical joined at the corner), break the entire rectangle that encompasses the L-shape
	* The L-shape might be larger than 3x3
* On a match of 4 in a line, break the entire row or column as apporpriate

# Design
Candy Crush has 1000s of levels. Let's get some variation going.

{: .todo}
* Set up a sequence of levels with different parameters
	* Make the level description a JSON file, XML file, or Scripted Object - Your Choice
* There is a 5th gem type (lemon)
	* Set it up so that each level uses a specified subset of the 5 fruits
* Vary the size of the grid for each level
* Vary the number of available moves
* On `GameOver()` advance to the next level in the sequence
* Create at least 3 different levels in the sequence

# Art
The true success of these games all comes down to the pizazz

{: .todo}
* There are some effect prefabs saved as
	* "Assets/Prefabs/FX_Ray_line_BLUE.prefab"
	* "Assets/Prefabs/FX_Ray_line_RED.prefab"
	* "Assets/Prefabs/FX_Ray_line_green.prefab"
	* "Assets/Prefabs/FX_Ray_line_orange.prefab"
* Add one of those to each row or column that breaks
	* Be sure to center it and rotate it to match up with the gems being broken
* Fill in the plain blue background with an image of some kind
* Change out the plain white rectangle of the grid with a checkerboard pattern of some sort

{: .note}
Be aware that this "Choose Your Path" is harder than those that have come before.\
**Especially** the Programming task.\
Keep in mind, you are allowed to choose any of the tasks.

{: .warn}
Be sure to commit and push everything.
