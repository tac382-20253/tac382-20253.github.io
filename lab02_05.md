# QuizGame.RunGame()

In `QuizGame.Start()`, you'll see that the game flow was kicked off with a call to:
```
        // begin the game
        StartCoroutine(RunGame());
```
Let's look at `RunGame()`:
```
    IEnumerator RunGame()
    {
        {   // TODO first wait for the phone to be upright
        }

        // Reset to the beginning of the list
        m_listElement = -1;
        bool isDone = NextQuestion();

        while (false == isDone)
        {
            {   // TODO wait for a choice (up or down)
                // then wait for 2 seconds
                // then wait for the phone to be re-centered
                // finally advance to the next question by calling NextQuestion()
            }
            yield return null;
        }

        // We are done... move on to the wrap-up screen
        SceneManager.LoadScene("End");
    }
```

# Wait for Center
The first **TODO** says to wait for the phone to be "upright" meaning centered.
```
        // TODO first wait for the phone to be upright
```
You'll need a loop here

{: .todo}
* Inside the loop:
	* Call `ReadInput()`
    * `yield return null`
* Continue the loop until `QuizInput.center` returned from `ReadInput()` is true

# Wait for Up or Down
You'll see we've already got a loop set up here:
```
        while (false == isDone)
        {
            // TODO wait for a choice (up or down)
            // then wait for 2 seconds
            // then wait for the phone to be re-centered
            // finally advance to the next question by calling NextQuestion()
            yield return null;
        }
```
We'll be adding loops inside this loop.

{: .todo}
* Call `ReadInput()`
* If the answer is neither `up` nor `down`:
    * `yield return null`
    * continue the loop
* If the answer is `up`:
    * call `Correct()`
    * wait for a minimum of 2 seconds with a `yield return new WaitForSeconds(2.0f)`
    * Add your own loop to `yield return null` until `ReadInput()` returns `center`
* If the answer is `down`:
    * call `Wrong()`
    * wait for a minimum of 2 seconds with a `yield return new WaitForSeconds(2.0f)`
    * Add your own loop to `yield return null` until `ReadInput()` returns `center`
* After your `up` or `down` portion,
    * continue the loop

{: .note}
Your code for `up` and `down` are almost identical.\
Feel free to combine those into a single shared block.\
I won't take off points if you do or don't. It's up to you.

{: .test}
The game should be fully functional now.
